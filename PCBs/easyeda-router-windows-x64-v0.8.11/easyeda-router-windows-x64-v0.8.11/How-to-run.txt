	Ubuntu17.04(x64) or other 64bit Linux
	MacOS(x64)
	
	Doesn't support 32bit system

2) Start local Auto Router:

	Double click "win64.bat" in Windows.
	Run "sh lin64.sh" on command prompt in Linux. Make sure the command prompt command path located the folder.
	Run "sh mac64.sh" on command prompt in MacOS.

3) If local auto router is unavailable:

	1) Chrome
	
		You need to upgrade Chrome to the newest version.	
	
	2) Firefox
	
		1. Type "about:config" into the address bar then press enter
		2. Search and double click the options as below (change the values to "true"):
			network.websocket.allowInsecureFromHTTPS
			security.mixed_content.block_active_content
		3. Re-open Firefox and try again.
		
4) If autorouter fail:
Auto router is not good enough, suggest routing manually, recommed "Routing Confilct - RoundTrack" at the PCB right-hand panel.
Sometimes, if you can't get it done, try the tips below.

-	Use local auto router rather than cloud server.
-	Make sure the net of PCB doesn't contain the special charaters, such as ` { } ^ ; ~ \ / [ ] =  etc. the chrarter - and _ are supported.
-	Make sure the board oultine is closed, doesn't has board oultine overlap situation.
-	Make sure there are no DRC cleance errors (short circuit issue), such as two different network pads overlapping, or different net pads in the same location within the package.
-	Make sure no footprint outside the board outline.
-	Make sure your canvas Gird size is set to 10mil, make sure the components align with the grid via: top menu - format - align grid.
-	Place some vias at suitable position, and modify the vias' net as you want.
-	Make sure PCB rule doesn't have 3 decimal places, EasyEDA auto router only support 2 decimal places.
-	Skip the GND nets, add copper area to GND net.
-	Use small tracks and small clearance, but make sure the value is more than 6mil.
-	Route some key tracks manually before auto routing and ignore them when auto routing. 
-	Add more layers, 4 layers or 6 layers. but that will make more cost.
-	Change the components layout, make them have more space between each other.
-	Don't make any via/pad overlap the different objects which can be set the net.
-	Stop the auto-router, close the script, and re-open the script to run local auto-router server again.
-	Sometimes, The auto-router won't work at the first time, please modify the layout and try serveral times.
-	If only a few remaining networks cannot be completed, it is a normal phenomenon. Please manually route the remaining networks.
-	Tell the error detail to us and send your PCB file as EasyEDA Source file to support@easyeda.com.
